## Running InterProScan on protein sequences

Notes on the installation of the InterProScan: https://github.com/ebi-pf-team/interproscan/wiki/HowToDownload.  
The code below will run InterProScan version 5.25-64.0 over all sequences in all_human_viral_proteins.fasta.   
-i specifies the input file  
-f specifies the output format  
-iprlookup tells to look up InterProID for features (only specific member database ID is returned by default)  
-goterms tells to look up GO terms associated with given InterProID  
-b specifies output file (format suffix like .gff3 will be added automatically)  

InterProScan works on Linux system only. /my_interproscan/interproscan-5.25-64.0/ should be located in dir1 "/dir1/dir2/viral_project"   

```{bash}
if [ -e ./processed_data_files/all_human_viral_protein_domains102017.gff3.gz ]
then
echo "InterProScan has been run before: all_human_viral_protein_domains102017.gff3.gz file exists"
else
../../my_interproscan/interproscan-5.25-64.0/interproscan.sh -i ./data_files/all_human_viral_proteins.fasta -f gff3 -iprlookup -goterms -b ./processed_data_files/all_human_viral_protein_domains102017
gzip ./processed_data_files/all_human_viral_protein_domains102017.gff3
fi
```
